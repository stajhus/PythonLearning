#Defining a Function to get the mean value of the elements in a list.
# Step 1 Define a funciton usind "def" and name it "myavgfun" and passing an argument for a list within the pranthesis "mylist". to define a function you need 3 things a) declaraing (def), naming (myavgfun), and passing argument (mylist) an dthe last is the addition of ":"
# Step 2 to retuen the funciton use "return" and I use sum and len arguments to find the mean value
# Step 3 define the mylist wihch is used int eh return and funciton 
# Step 4 get the value of the return in aanother variable I called it avg
# Step 5 print the value of the return which is now stored in the variable "avg" and I use "round" to roundoff the value to the 2 digit after the decimle. 

def myavgfun(mylist):
	
	return sum(mylist) / len(mylist)
    
mylist = [2,3,4,5,4,5,4]
avg=myfun(xyz)

print("Average of listxyz is:", round(avg,2))
print("Average of listxyz is:", avg)    


# printing the date of birth of by calling the function DOB:
def DOB (mdob):
	return mdob
    
mdob = 18021987
det=DOB(mdob)



def averageheight (tenthclass):
  return sum(tenthclass) / len(tenthclass)

tenthclass = [5,6,6,5,7,4,4]

resultoftheightfunction=averageheight (tenthclass)
print("this is the value of the average height of the class we studied is: ",  round(resultoftheightfunction,2))
